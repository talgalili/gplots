\title{ Makes a half or full normal plot for the effects from an aov model }
\description{
  Makes a half or full normal plot for the effects from a model
  inheriting from
  class \code{aov}. One can interactively label the points in the plot.
}
\usage{
\method{qqnorm}{aov}(y, full=FALSE, label=FALSE, omit=NULL,
           xlab=paste(if (full) "" else "Half", " Normal plot"), 
           ylab="Effects", ...)
}

\arguments{
  \item{y}{A model object inheriting from \code{aov}}
   \item{full}{Full or half normal plot (half is default) }
   \item{label}{If \code{TRUE}, function allows interactive
     labelling of points in plot, using the mouse }
   \item{omit}{Numeric or character vector of effects to omit,
     the intercept is always omitted}
   \item{xlab}{Horizontal axix label }
   \item{ylab}{Vertical axis label }
   \item{\dots}{Further arguments to be given to the plot function }
}
\details{
   Produces a (half) normal plot of the effects from an AOV model. The
   idea behind the plot is that most effects will be small or null, and
   this effects can be used as a basis for estimation of the
   experimental variance. This small effects will show up in the plot as
   a straight line, other effects can be judged against this as a
   background. Heavily used by Box, Hunter \& Hunter, which attributes
   the idea to Daniel.
}
\value{
  If \code{label=TRUE}, the vector of points identified, else nothing of
   interest.
